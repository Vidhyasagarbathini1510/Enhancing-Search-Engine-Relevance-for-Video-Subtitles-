    "Converting Audio to Subtitles for Enhanced Searchability\n",
    "With the increasing volume of audio and video content, converting speech into searchable text is essential for content accessibility, indexing, and search engine optimization. Automatic speech recognition (ASR) enables the extraction of subtitles from audio files, making them easier to analyze, retrieve, and enhance with AI-powered search techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook focuses on automatically generating subtitles from audio files using advanced machine learning models. The extracted subtitles can then be processed and indexed for better search relevance, semantic retrieval, and AI-driven recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps Involved:\n",
    "Install Required Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "We install key dependencies like Torch, Sentence-Transformers, OpenAI-Whisper, FFmpeg, and SciPy, which are crucial for processing audio and generating text.\n",
    "Load and Process Audio Files\n",
    "\n",
    "Audio files are preprocessed to ensure compatibility with speech recognition models.\n",
    "Generate Subtitles Using OpenAI Whisper\n",
    "\n",
    "Whisper, a powerful ASR model, transcribes audio into high-quality text with minimal errors.\n",
    "Store and Optimize Subtitles\n",
    "\n",
    "Extracted subtitles are saved in a structured format for further cleaning and indexing.\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, we will have a fully functional subtitle generation pipeline, ready for integration into search engines or AI-based retrieval systems.\n",
