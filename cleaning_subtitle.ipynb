Thats not even where we met We met in Orvieto Italy What In Italy Yeah I only spent one year on the ship then I hopped off I ended up working as a caregiver Then I met my employer He looks like your grandfather Thats why I felt at ease taking care of him Did you have a hard time taking care of him Not really but its the loneliness that will get you There arent many Filipinos there Plus Seor Luigis vineyard was in a provincial area Oh Last year his closest friends visited him Monica was with them But after a few days Seor Luigi passed away Monica was the one who helped me She really surprised me She didnt mind doing the work Washing the dishes Serving the funeral guests Really Miss Monica did Yeah Really She doesnt seem to be the type Hey shes not like that Thank you I think youre talking about a different girlfriend Tonio You just dont know Monica like I do So why did Miss Monica tell me that she met you on a cruise ship Maybe because thats where we bonded When Seor Luigi died he left me a lot of money And he left strict instructions for me to go on vacation So when Monica told me she was going on a cruise I went with her Thats where you got to know all of Monica Meaning thats where you meddled with Monicas mufflers Mama Mae so so what Im just worried about you I just dont want you getting hurt by Tonios answer because you know Mama Mae whatever Tonio says

Unbelievable Go to the province with you What Why Ill introduce you to my family Ill also show you my woodwork I want to prove to you that setting up a furniture shop wont be a waste of money I just cant see myself running a highend bar Is this because I missed dinner last night So youre backing out Is that it Monica Im not interested in setting up a bar Then study up on it Why do you keep insisting on this furniture thing Monica youre my girlfriend but you dont seem to have faith in me Unlike Steph who has complete faith in me Ants sorry I have faith in you Okay Im gonna reconsider that furniture thing But I cant go to the province with you Maybe next time okay Move my meeting with Mr Reyes to pm and tell him Im on my way okay Yes maam Miss Monica Yes Can I ask you something Okay Make it fast because Im busy What I saw your car outside the restaurant last night Why didnt you come in Follow me Actually I kind of feel guilty about it I just wish life was less complicated When I met him in Italy I was still heartbroken over Andrew So when Anton told me he wanted to come with me on the cruise I was okay with it Normally I wouldnt have allowed it because I barely knew him But you know he made me laugh He made me feel beautiful and special Have you ever felt that way Steph His rural attitude His corny humor Even his bad grammar All of that was so wonderful That was back then When we were still in paradise But not now when were back in the real world Its just better to introduce him to family and friends as a fellow passenger that I met on a cruise ship Theres no way that I would tell them Im in a relationship with a seaman Turned caregiver Its embarrassing He had an honorable job Steph dont be so naive After all were in the world of PR And thats not the point This is the first guy who is willing to do anything for me who is willing to change for me Thats why I really want this relationship to work But you confronting me like this and planting seeds of hope in his furniture shop Miss Monica if you could just give Anton a chance I did I told him I would reconsider But only after Ive been proven wrong That its not going to be a waste of money Catch my drift Steph I think this is going beyond what Miss Monica is asking of you This is girlfriendlevel effort for a guy you claim to be just a friend Steph Im just concerned for you This might be another MU for you A MisUnderstanding with Major Uncertainty Come on Lets grab some lunch Okay I might lose some weight Oh gosh Im super excited Im ready for the beach See Look at me I put on sunscreen Oh
